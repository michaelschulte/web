I was unsure what to expect but got a lot of bang for my buck (which is great) \u0026#8211; as a side note I would recommend first timers to try to go there with a concrete project or question or problem, I think there is a good chance to find people with similar issues interested in collaborations.     Here is an observation I would be interested to hear your thoughts on: in the SIPS world everything seems to be really straight forward \u0026#8211; we want to \u0026#8216;unfuck psych science\u0026#8217; (Lindsay, 2018), we want to pre-reg studies, upload data, learn R, comment on code, accelerate science, ‘do it right this time’, collaborate, respect, be inclusive (I really learned a lot in that regard listening to your podcast and talking to people at SIPS) …   All of that is great. I subscribe to all of these points.     Here is the twist \u0026#8211; people @SIPS talk about \u0026#8216;a movement’ (something that seems very American to me), maybe a movement is needed; people @SIPS talk about ‘a revolution’ \u0026#8211; again, great! obviously there is a need to rattle the cage and accelerate things beyond ‘paradigm shifts at funerals’ (Planck?)   BUT   What happens if you go ‘Outside the SIPS Bubble\u0026#8217; (OSIPSB)?   I have no data (other than my own experiences) but I wonder whether the world (psychology, other sciences) is actually that ready, that willing and open to adopt to these new standards and to actually make a paradigm shift in how we do science. I work at a business school (consumer psych and JDM) there is a lot of finger pointing going on toward psychology (I have a similar feeling that within psychology there is a lot of finger pointing toward social psych) \u0026#8211; \u0026#8216;this is clearly a problem of psychologists but not of us [economists, consumer psychologists, business, accounting researchers \u0026#8230;]’.   Another OSIPSB experience I had was talking to an Action Editor of the Journal of Consumer Psychology (JCR) last year \u0026#8211; we got into a heated debate about the most basic issues, eg, sharing data, pre-reg studies …     Is this an observation you share? What would be good steps to address these issues? Should we talk about this within SIPS to get a better balance between enthusiasm and real world requirements (eg hiring decisions are still made mostly by senior faculty, assuming my observation hold, less interested in replication than ’new and exciting effects’ (quote anonymous senior AE of JCR).     Thanks for your thoughts!

A third of these fatal accidents are attributed to speeding, with properties of the individual driver and the environment regarded as key contributing factors. We examine real-world speeding behavior and its interaction with illuminance, an environmental property defined as the luminous flux incident on a surface. Drawing on an analysis of 1.2 million vehicle movements, we show that reduced illuminance levels are associated with increased speeding. This relationship persists when we control for factors known to influence speeding (e.g., fluctuations in traffic volume) and consider proxies of illuminance (e.g., sight distance). Our findings add to a long-standing debate about how the quality of visual conditions affects drivers’ speed perception and driving speed. Policy makers can intervene by educating drivers about the inverse illuminance‒speeding relationship and by testing how improved vehicle headlights and smart road lighting can attenuate speeding.\n","date":1515502049,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515502049,"objectID":"10215b6e797ee1196592c10fab3f52a1","permalink":"/post/2018-01-09-blind-haste-aka-im-blindflug/","publishdate":"2018-01-09T05:47:29-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-01-09-blind-haste-aka-im-blindflug/","section":"post","summary":"Chance encounters sometimes lead to interesting and new projects.

Accuracy (Matching Scores) was computed to assess and compare the classification quality. Results show a large variance in accura- cy across emotions and databases, with a performance advan- tage for FACET over AFFDEX. In Study 2, 110 participants’ facial expressions were measured while being exposed to emotionally evocative pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), the Geneva Affective Picture Database (GAPED) and the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). Accuracy again differed for distinct emo- tions, and FACET performed better. Overall, iMotions can achieve acceptable accuracy for standardized pictures of prototypical (vs. natural) facial expressions, but performs worse for more natural facial expressions.

If you see dim traces of interesting patterns, try to reorganize the data to bring them into bolder relief. If there are participants you don’t like, or trials, observers, or interviewers who gave you anomalous results, drop them (temporarily). Go on a fishing expedition for something — anything — interesting. ”\n‘Go on a fishing expidition’ – why should there come anything good from such advise? Bem goes on …\n“No, this is not immoral (SIC!). The rules of scientific and statistical inference that we overlearn in graduate school apply to the “Context of Justification.” They tell us what we can conclude in the articles we write for public consumption, and they give our readers criteria for deciding whether or not to believe us.

One likely reason is that for expectation models (e.g., CPT), it is often assumed that people behaved only as if they conducted the computations leading to the predicted choice and that the models are thus mute regarding information processing. We suggest that key psychological constructs in CPT, such as loss aversion and outcome and probability sensitivity, can be interpreted in terms of attention allocation. In two experiments, we tested hypotheses about specific links between CPT parameters and attentional regularities. Experiment 1 used process tracing to monitor partici- pants’ predecisional attention allocation to outcome and probability information. As hypothesized, individual differences in CPT’s loss-aversion, outcome-sensitivity, and probability-sensitivity parameters (estimated from participants’ choices) were systematically associated with individual differences in attention allocation to outcome and probability information. For instance, loss aversion was associated with the relative attention allocated to loss and gain outcomes, and a more strongly curved weighting function was associated with less attention allocated to probabilities. Experiment 2 manipulated participants’ attention to losses or gains, causing systematic differences in CPT’s loss-aversion parameter. This result indicates that attention allocation can to some extent cause choice regularities that are captured by CPT. Our findings demonstrate an as-if model’s capacity to reflect characteristics of information processing. We suggest that the observed CPT–attention links can be harnessed to inform the development of process models of risky choice.","tags":null,"title":"Prospect Theory Reflects Selective Allocation of Attention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Nanon L Spaanjaars","Cilia LM Witteman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"4bebe1073eb43a4bace905391809884c","permalink":"/publication/schulte-2015-visibility/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/schulte-2015-visibility/","section":"publication","summary":"This study investigates decision making in mental health care.

The aim of the current study was to investigate differences in preferred reasoning styles of novice and experienced clinical psychologists as possible explanation of this surprising phenomenon. We investigated clinical and control decisions of novice (n = 20) and experienced (n = 20) clinical psychologists as well as age-matched controls (n = 20 and n = 20 respectively) by using vignettes and MouselabWeb matrices. We assessed their reasoning style preferences by using the Rational-Experiential Inventory (Pacini \u0026 Epstein, 1999). Results showed that experienced and novice clinical psychologists did not differ in diagnostic accuracy and that experienced psychologists had a higher preference for rational thinking than novices. We also found that in experienced psy- chologists a stronger preference for deliberation was associated with greater accuracy, and in novice psychologists a stronger preference for intuitive reasoning was associated with less accurate decisions. It might be that it is not a question of more experience but of deliberation about the task that could help clinicians perform more accurately.","tags":null,"title":"Deliberative versus intuitive diagnostic decision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Lejarraga","Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Daniel Smedema"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"584a94d7b267f582d7c214d0d9b603ff","permalink":"/publication/lejarraga-2016-pyetribe/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lejarraga-2016-pyetribe/","section":"publication","summary":"The recent introduction of inexpensive eyetrackers has opened up a wealth of opportunities for researchers to study attention in interactive tasks.

This is work in collaboration with the Nestlé Research Center in Lausanne.\nHere is the reference:\nSchulte-Mecklenbeck, M., Sohn, M., Bellis, E., Martin, N., \u0026 Hertwig, R. (2013). A Lack of Appetite for Information and Computation: Simple Heuristics in Food Choice. Appetite, 71, 242–251. Abstract\nThe predominant, but largely untested, assumption in research on food choice is that people obey the classic commandments of rational behavior: they carefully look up every piece of relevant information, weight each piece according to subjective importance, and then combine them into a judgment or choice. In real world situations, however, the available time, motivation, and computational resources may simply not suffice to keep these commandments.

Using this tool, acquisition behavior and visual attention can be recorded in an unobtrusive way with a wide variety of different stimuli. Because of the structure of the stimuli in Flashlight, information acquisition behavior can be measured similarly to how eye tracking works, but unlike eye tracking systems, Flashlight can be implemented without any special equipment. The motivation for developing a new process-tracing tool comes from experience with existing process tracing methods and their limitations. Other existing pro- cess tracing tools restrict the structure of information (often in a rigid matrix similar to an information board); require a fixed and confided laboratory setup; and need specialized hardware and software that is both expensive to purchase and operate. Flashlight solves these issues by providing a free open source adaptable software package that can work via a Web browser on any Internet connected personal com- puter. Moreover, the researcher has great flexibility in how stimuli are constructed and presented, and Flashlight also enables easy access to a large number of participants through Internet based experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Flashlight as a process tracing method","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Decision Making","ego depletion"],"content":"The New York Times published a nice overview of the work on decision making and ego depletion (often ego depletion is used as a synonym with resource depletion, which is somewhat confusing because of the use of the later in economy to described the situation when raw materials are exhausted in a region).\nA new paper from Jonathan Levav (now at Standford – congrats!) is prominently featured in the above article.

All of these steps are closed to the public except for the last one – the publication of the (often substantially) revised version of the paper. Journal editors and reviewers evaluate the written work submitted to them, they trust that the analyses described in the submission are done in a principled and correct way. Editors and reviewers are the only external part of this process who will have an active influence on what analyses are done. After the publication of an article the public has the opportunity to write comments or ask the authors for the actual datasets for re-analysis. Often however, getting access to data from published papers is hard, if not often impossible (Savage \u0026amp; Vickers, 2009; Wicherts, Borsboom, Kats, \u0026amp; Molenaar, 2006). Unfortunately only the gist of the analyses are described in the paper and neither exact verification nor innovative additional analyses are possible.\nWhat could be a solution for this problem? An example from computer science provides a concept called “literate programming” which was advocated by one of the field’s grandmasters, Donald Knuth, in 1984. Knuth suggested that documentation (comments in the code) should be just as important as the actual code itself. This idea was reflected nearly 20 years later when Schwab et al. (2000) formulated a concept that “replication by other scientists” is a central aim and guardian for intellectual quality; they coined the term “reproducible research” for such a process.\nLet’s move the research process to a more open, reproducible structure, in which scientific peers have the ability to evaluate not only the final publication but also the data and the analyses.\nIdeally, research papers would have code for analyses which are commented in detail and are submitted in tandem with drafts as well as the original datasets. Anybody, not only a restricted group of select reviewers and editors, could reproduce all the steps of the analysis and follow the logic of arguments on not only the conceptual level but at an analytic level as well. This openness facilities easy reanalysis of data also. Meta-analysis could be done more frequently and with greater resolution as the actual data are available. Moreover, this configuration would allow us collectively to estimate effects in the population and not restrict our attention to independent small samples (see Henrich, Heine, \u0026amp; Norenzayan, 2010 for a discussion of this topic).\nWhat do we need to achieve this? From a policy perspective, journals would have to add the requirement for data and code submission together with the draft of each empirical paper. Some journals already provide the option to do that (e.g., Behavior Research Methods) in the supplemental material section on a voluntary base, some require the submission of all necessary material to replicate the reported results (e.g., Econometrica), however most do not offer such a possibility (it is of course possible to provide such materials through private or university web sites, but this is a haphazard and decentralized arrangement).\nTools are a second important part of facilitating this openness. Three open source (free of cost) components could provide the bases for reproducible research:\n R (R Development Core Team, 2010) is widely recognized (cite) as the “language of statistics” and builds on writing code instead of a “click and forget” type of analysis that other software packages encourage. R is open source, comes with a large number of extensions for advanced statistical analysis and can be run on any computer platform, including as a Web based application (http://www.R-project.org). LaTeX was invented to provide a tool for anybody to produce high quality publications independent of the computer system used (i.e. one could expect the same results everywhere, http://www.latex-project.org/). Sweave (Leisch, 2002) connects R and LaTeX providing the opportunity to write a research paper and do the data analysis in parallel, in a well documented and reproducible way (http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/).  The power of these different tools comes from the combination of their being open source, their widespread adoption (across a wide range of fields in sciences), and the fully transparent means by which data analysis is conducted and reported. It levels the playing field and means that anybody with an Internet connection and a computer can take part in evolving scientific progress.\nJohn Godfrey Saxe famously said that: “Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made.” We should strive that this is not true for psychology as a science.\n ","date":1300221049,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1300221049,"objectID":"355daac93a5d9abab68eed398ab141c1","permalink":"/post/2011-03-15-psychology-as-a-reproducible-science/","publishdate":"2011-03-15T13:30:49-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2011-03-15-psychology-as-a-reproducible-science/","section":"post","summary":"Is Psychology ready for reproducible research?\nToday the typical research process in psychology looks generally like this: we collect data; analyze them in many ways; write a draft article based on some of the results; submit the draft to a journal; maybe produce a revision following the suggestions of the reviewers and editors; and hopefully live long enough to actually see it published.","tags":null,"title":"Psychology as a reproducible Science","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Decision Making"],"content":" Here is what Andrew Gelman writes about an interview Colin Camerer gave on Spousomonics … Looking forward to Camerer’s reply …\n","date":1298969923,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1298969923,"objectID":"98281b098f4b02ca90c16f0cba6b9b55","permalink":"/post/2011-03-01-blog-attack/","publishdate":"2011-03-01T01:58:43-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2011-03-01-blog-attack/","section":"post","summary":"Here is what Andrew Gelman writes about an interview Colin Camerer gave on Spousomonics … Looking forward to Camerer’s reply …","tags":null,"title":"Blog-attack","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Anton Kuhberger","Rob Ranyard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"d6d193d8cef39f68d693445e555caf0a","permalink":"/publication/kuhberger-2011-handbook/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kuhberger-2011-handbook/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Handbook of Process Tracing Methods for Decision Research: A Critical Review and User's Guide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Anton Kühberger","Rob Ranyard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"57184c53302a9696d635d9331f179b4f","permalink":"/publication/schulte-2011-handbook/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/schulte-2011-handbook/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A handbook of process tracing methods for decision research: A critical review and user’s guide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oswald Huber","ODILO W Huber","MICHAEL Schulte-Mecklenbeck"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"02d248c7024f49bf9a0aef2384a9da48","permalink":"/publication/huber-2011-determining/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/huber-2011-determining/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Determining the information participants need: methods of active information search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Ryan O Murphy","Florian Hutzler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"58b072c831eb4a3d1dae020de118ccf8","permalink":"/publication/schulte-2011-flashlight/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/schulte-2011-flashlight/","section":"publication","summary":"A flashlight enables a person to see part of the world in the dark. As a person directs a flashlight beam to certain places in the environment, it serves as a manifestation of their attention, interest and focus. In this paper we introduce Flashlight, an open-source (free) web-based software package that can be used to col- lect continuous and non-obtrusive measures of users’ information acquisition behavior. Flashlight offers a cost effective and rapid way to collect data on how long and how often a participant reviews information in different areas of visual stimuli. It provides the functionality of other open source process tracing tools, like MouselabWeb, and adds the capability to present any static visual stimulus. We report the results from three different types of stimuli presented with both the Flashlight tool and a traditional eye-tracker. We found no differences measuring simple outcome data (e.g., choices in gambles or performance on algebraic tasks) between the two methods.

We draw on our experience of editing the “Handbook of process tracing methods for decision research” recently published in the SJDM series. After a brief introduction we first describe classic process tracing methods (thinking aloud, Mouselab, eye-tracking). Then we present a series of examples of how each of these techniques has made important contributions to the development and testing of process models of JDM. We discuss the issue of large data volumes resulting from process tracing and remedies for handling those. Finally, we argue for the importance of formulating process hypotheses and opt for a multi-method approach that focuses on the cross-validation of findings.","tags":null,"title":"The role of process data in the development and testing of process models of judgment and decision making.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Science"],"content":"The illustrated guide from Kindergarten to PhD …\nhttp://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/\n","date":1282137629,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1282137629,"objectID":"fff84584b4e10da91e0cd34636cecf8a","permalink":"/post/2010-08-18-where-you-end-up-having-a-phd/","publishdate":"2010-08-18T06:20:29-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2010-08-18-where-you-end-up-having-a-phd/","section":"post","summary":"The illustrated guide from Kindergarten to PhD …\nhttp://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/","tags":null,"title":"Where you end up, having a PhD","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["LaTeX","Tech"],"content":"http://docs.latexlab.org/docs\nLaTeX and Google Docs together in one nice (free)application – this is a brilliant idea, which gives you the power of LaTeX combined with the excellent collaboration possiblities of Google Docs – if I would have a button it would say “I like” …\nHere is a screenshot from the project page – with LaTeX code on one side and the final output on the other …\n","date":1279183794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1279183794,"objectID":"07acca67eb7bc159890f3ae9571e25e9","permalink":"/post/2010-07-15-two-good-things-come-together/","publishdate":"2010-07-15T01:49:54-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2010-07-15-two-good-things-come-together/","section":"post","summary":"http://docs.latexlab.org/docs\nLaTeX and Google Docs together in one nice (free)application – this is a brilliant idea, which gives you the power of LaTeX combined with the excellent collaboration possiblities of Google Docs – if I would have a button it would say “I like” …","tags":null,"title":"two good things come together","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R","Statistics"],"content":"Across the street at the Revolution blog a nice example of using R with data from the cloud (see another post on this topic here) shows us the distribution of fouls during the just finished World Cup in a nice barchart.

Researchers—often implicitly—assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species—frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior—hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.\n—\nI would like to make three suggestions that could help to overcome the era of WEIRD subjects and generate more reliable and representative data. These suggestions will mainly touch contrasts 2, 3 and 4 elaborated by Henrich, Heine and Norezayan. While my suggestions tackle these contrasts from a technical and experimental perspective they do not provide a general solution for the first contrast on industrialized versus small scale societies. Here are my suggestions: 1) replications in multiple labs, 2) internet based experimentation and 3) drawing representative samples from a population.\nThe first suggestion, replication in multiple labs, foremost touches aspects like replication, multiple populations and open data access. For a publication in a journal a replication of an experiment in a different lab would be obligatory. The replication would then be published with the original, e.g., in the form of a comment. This would ensure that other research labs in other states or countries are involved and very different parts of the population could be sampled. Also results of experiments would be freely available to the public and the data sharing problem in Psychology, as described in the target article, but also in other fields like Medicine (Savage \u0026amp; Vieckers, 2009) would be a problem of the past. Of course such a step would be closely linked with certain standards on the one hand in building experiments and on the other hand in storing data. While a standard way to build experiments seems unlikely there are many methods available in computer science to store data in a reusable, for example through the usage of XML (Extensible Markup Language).\nThe second suggestion is based on the drawing of representative samples from the population. As described in the target article, research often suffers from a restriction to extreme subgroups from the population, from which generalized results are drawn. However, there is published work that overcomes these restrictions. As an example I would like to use the Hertwig, Zangerl, Biedert and Margraf (2008) paper on probabilistic numeracy. The authors based their study on a random-quote sample from the Swiss population including indicators as language, area where participant is living, gender and age. To fulfill all the necessary criteria 1000 participants were recruited using telephone interviews. Such studies are certainly more expensive and somewhat restricted to simpler experimental setups (Hertwig et al., used telephone interviews based on questionnaires).\nThe third suggestion adds additional data collection in a second location: the Internet. The emphasis in the last sentence should be set on ‘add’. Data collection solely Internet based is of course possible, already often performed and published in high impact journals. Online experimentation is technically much less demanding than ten years ago due to the availability of ready made solutions for questionnaires or even experiments. The point I would like to make here should not be built on a separation of lab and online based experiments. My suggestion combines these two research locations and enables a researcher to profit from the many benefits arising. A possible scenario could include running an experiment in the laboratory first to guarantee, among other things, high control on the situation in order to show an effect with a small, restricted sample. In a second step the experiment is transferred to the Web and run online, admittedly giving away some of the control but providing the large benefit of having access to a diverse, large samples of participants from different populations easily. As an example I would like to point to a recent blog and related experiments started by Paolacci and Warglien (2009) at the University of Venice, Italy. These researchers started replicating well known experiments from the decision making literature like framing, anchoring or the conjunction fallacy with a service called the Mechanical Turk provided by Amazon. This service is based on the idea of crowdsourcing (outsourcing a task to a large group of people) and lets a researcher have easy access to a large group of motivated participants.\nSome final words on the combination and possible restrictions of the three suggestions. What would a combination of all three suggestions look like? It would be a replication of experiments, using representative samples of different populations in online experiments. This seems useful from a data quality, logistics and prize point of view. However, several issues were left untouched in my discussion, such as the question of independence of the second lab for replication studies, the restriction of representative samples to one country (as opposed to multiple comparisons as routinely found in, e.g., anthropological studies), the differences between online and lab based experimentation or the instances where equipment needed for an experiments (e.g., eye trackers or fMRI) does not allow for online experimentation. Keeping that in mind the above suggestions draw an idealized picture of how to run experiments and re-use the collected data, nevertheless I would argue that such steps could help to reduce the percentage of WEIRD subjects in research substantially.\nReferences\nHertwig, R., Zangerl, M.A., Biedert, E., \u0026amp; Margraf, J.

The authors examine a recently proposed choice strategy, the priority heuristic, which provides a novel account of how people make risky choices. The authors identify a number of properties that the priority heuristic should have as a process model and illustrate how they may be tested. The results, along with prior research, suggest that although the priority heuristic captures some variability in the attention paid to outcomes, it fails to account for major characteristics of the data, particularly the frequent transitions between outcomes and their probabilities. The article concludes with a discussion of the properties that should be captured by process models of risky choice and the role of process data in theory development.\n","date":1205783758,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1205783758,"objectID":"7e89cd1059247a1f4aa01425ac8cac20","permalink":"/post/2008-03-17-priority-heuristic-comment/","publishdate":"2008-03-17T12:55:58-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/2008-03-17-priority-heuristic-comment/","section":"post","summary":"We (Johnson, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, \u0026amp; Willemsen, 2008) have got a new paper out that comments on the Priority Heuristic as described in Brandstaetter, Gigerenzer and Hertwig, 2006.\nResolution of debates in cognition usually comes from the introduction of constraints in the form of new data about either the process or representation.","tags":null,"title":"Priority Heuristic comment","type":"post"},{"authors":["Eric J Johnson","Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Martijn C Willemsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199142000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199142000,"objectID":"8fb498a80f6e89a52589083bae980b5f","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2008-postscript/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2008-postscript/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Postscript: Rejoinder to Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, and Hertwig (2008).","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric J Johnson","Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Martijn C Willemsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199142000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199142000,"objectID":"60026496a20525298201d615d7f33c8d","permalink":"/publication/johnson-2008-process/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-2008-process/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Process models deserve process data: Comment on Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, and Hertwig (2006).","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104534000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104534000,"objectID":"2f20eab198c4b3b9df2eef99c573f25a","permalink":"/publication/schulte-2005-brave/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/schulte-2005-brave/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Brave New World...

In Experiment 1, significantly more information was searched for in the laboratory than on the Web when the list version was employed, whereas there was no difference between locations in the keyword version.

A particularly relevant factor that affects the match between real decisions and hypothetical decisions is the importance of a decisionÕs consequences. In the literature experimental gam- bles tend to confound the reality of the decision situation with the size of the payoffs: hypothetical decisions tend to offer large payoffs, and real decisions tend to offer only small payoffs. Using the well-known framing effect (a tendency of risk-aversion for gains and of risk-seeking for losses) we find that the framing effect depends on payoff size but hypothetical choices match real choices for small as well as large payoffs. These results appear paradoxical unless size of incentive is clearly distinguished from the reality status of decision (real versus hypothetical). Since the field lacks a general theory of when hypothetical decisions match real decisions, the discussion presents an outline for developing such a theory.","tags":null,"title":"Framing decisions: Hypothetical and real","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anton Kühberger","Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck","Josef Perner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":915145200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":915145200,"objectID":"def1addeb15ac5a13bba233d47b84162","permalink":"/publication/kuhberger-1999-effects/","publishdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kuhberger-1999-effects/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The effects of framing, reflection, probability, and payoff on risk preference in choice tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anton Kühberger","Josef Perner","Michael Schulte","Robert Leingruber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":788914800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":788914800,"objectID":"6497ee2ef9a3fe2bb48191c2a332dc14","permalink":"/publication/kuhberger-1995-choice/","publishdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kuhberger-1995-choice/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Choice or no choice: is the langer effect evidence against simulation?","type":"publication"}]
