abstract = "Contemporary research on intuitive decision making emphasises the automaticity
of intuitive compared to deliberate decision making processes. While automaticity cannot be observed directly, it is closely associated with unconscious or implicit mental processes that are studied within the implicit cognition domain. Research on intuitive decision making might therefore benefit from integrating operational criteria of consciousness from this research area. We discuss the applicability of two process tracing tools, namely Mouselab and eye-tracking, for studying intuitive decision making and assessing automatic behaviour. While Mouselab, in its traditional form, remains a tool more suitable for assessing deliberate processes, eye-tracking holds the potential of allowing insights in the intuitive, automatic domain. We point to additional measures that could be integrated with these process tracing tools in order to identify whether or not participants are conscious of the basis of their decision."
