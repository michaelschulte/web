abstract = "We describe WebDiP (Web Decision Processes)--an open-source, online tool-which enables a researcher to track participants while they search for information in a database, available through the Internet. After various instructions on setup and configuration are given, a detailed view of WebDiP explains the system's technical features. Furthermore, other open-source tools are mentioned that helped in programming WebDiP, running it, or analyzing data gathered with it. We present new approaches of how open-source thinking can be incorporated into a research process and discuss future perspectives of WebDiP."
